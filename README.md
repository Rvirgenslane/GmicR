Combines WGCNA and xCell with Bayesian network learning to generate a Gene-Module Immune-Cell network

Are you a fan of CD4 T cells? Do B cells really interested you? Are curious about how fibroblasts or macrophages in the
lung may be influenced by gene modules? These are the types of relationships that can be visualized by this pacakge from 
bulk tissue RNAseq data.

The goal behind this tool is to provide biomedical researchers, like myself, with a way to come up with 
new molecules of interests or biological functions to explore. WGCNA module eigengenes and xCell immune cell signatures are
merged, relationships can be visualized in the form of a Bayesian network learned using BNlearning. 

Inverse relationships can also be highlighted!

This is my first repository on GitHub! 

I thank the community in advanced for helping to refine this package into a tool that may help advance biomedical research.
